# Ada Unhandled Exception Example
This example demonstrates a common issue in Ada programming: unhandled exceptions.

The `Example` procedure initializes an array and attempts to process it.  However, it lacks comprehensive exception handling, potentially leading to unexpected program termination if any errors occur during array processing.

The corresponding solution file (`bugSolution.ada`) shows how to improve exception handling for better robustness.
